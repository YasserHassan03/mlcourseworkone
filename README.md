# ML CW1 Decision trees

Go to line 333 of `decisionTree.py`  and put the file path to the data you wish to test then Run

 

```bash
python3 decisionTree.py
```

You should get:

- Accuracy of the model
- Precision of the model
- Recall of the model
- F1 scores of the model
- A confusion matrix of the model
- A matplotlib plot of the decision tree (note: for leaf nodes text is sometimes difficult to read but this is solved by zooming in on the matplotlib GUI)
