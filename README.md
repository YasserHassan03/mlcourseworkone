To run this, do the following:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m venv my_venv
source my_venv/bin/activate  
pip install -r data/requirements.txt
```

At this point go to line 333 of `decisionTree.py`  and put the file path you wish to test then Run

 

```bash
python3 decisionTree.py
```

You should get:

- Accuracy of the model
- Precision of the model
- Recall of the model
- F1 scores of the model
- A confusion matrix of the model
- A matplotlib plot of the decision tree
